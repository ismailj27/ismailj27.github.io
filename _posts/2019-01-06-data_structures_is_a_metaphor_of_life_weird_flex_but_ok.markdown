Well, in simpler terms. I'd say Data Structures is the efficient organizing of data, for easier acess and management. By categorizing data, branching and breaking data into more data, etc.

So it would be a metaphor of life.  Life, both physically, and psychologically, is threads of data. Threads connected through some medium. Family being one of the biggest ones.

Family tree is a structure of how everyone is connected. A structure that is expanded and manipulated through births, marriages, adoptions, etc

And an even bigger people structure would be, well, all of us. We come in different types and forms, connected through some type of relationship and/or goal, and forming even more connections and groups.

Alright back to more, data structuring? Weird flex indeed, heh.
