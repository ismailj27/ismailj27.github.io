Well, this is long overdue. Let’s blame it on diving into coursework, heh. Alright, let’s get to it.

To answer the big question in simplest terms. I got into software development because I want to do work I’m truly passionate for - developing and innovating products, that affect people’s lives.

Quick rewind about a decade back. I completed an associate degree in Electrical Engineering Technology. And I could have gone into the technical industry. But I was seduced by the … quite well paying … sales industry. Obviously, not that technical industry doesn’t pay. But I guess you hook onto the first fish when hungry (I should have fasted). And so I gave in, hustled, and I can’t say I regret the pay either. But my uncle used to say something that goes “Your nature is always beside you. And will frequently remind you of its presence.”

It’s always being in my nature to want to build and fix anything I can get my hands on. And everything can be innovated. I’m the guy that would probably ask to let me fix your computer. The guy that’d rather stay home on Saturday nights to watch engineering documentaries and tutorials. I can’t leave a problem unsolved, nor a project incomplete. Well it wouldn’t sit well on my conscience anyway.

And so sales, though rewarding in lots of ways, took a lot of my time and attention. And my true passion kept surfacing up to my consciousness. Like balloons getting released from underwater. Years passed, and the hustle continued, and so did the unignorably whispers of my passion. Amplifying my desire to build and tweak things. And so I started leaking my first love some attention. I’d pull out my robotic kit and do some soldering and wiring, do some software simulations of electronic circuits, and work on other projects. Then I ended up in programming, a world where you can directly build and tweak complete and amazing projects/products. All with just a computer. From anywhere. And though in-person teaching is probably irreplaceable, it seemed to me you can learn most, if not all you need, online. Which was the “cherry on top” for me. Especially in the case of working a full time job.

So I started with watching a couple of programming tutorial videos, now and then. I built a couple of basic java and python applications, and did some coding challenges. But something was still missing - building or working on something that actually affects people’s lives every day. So I decided it’s time to fully start the developer journey, the developer career. I started subscribing to programming websites that gives you more in depth tutorial and direct help. Yet in the past, Flatiron had actually being recommended to me by friends and family. So I did my thorough research and tried the bootcamp prep, and the course and live help was just glorious. So I applied, and thankfully made it through the door.

And so here we are. I am Coding. Sighing. Night-owling. "huuuh"-ing. “Ohhh”-ing. Self-shoulder-tapping. Epipha-nizing ? You know the dance, I’m sure. Or will soon enough. I’m confident it’s going to be quite the journey. A journey I'm not traveling alone. And so I hope we all Flatironians make it to the glorious destiantion we do deserve.

So I’d say working in sales for the past decade, has definitely being wonderful and rewarding. Especially that feeling of delivering products and services that exponentially improves people’s lives. But one of the things I’ve truly learned from the front lines, is that there is always room for improvement, for innovation! It’s a cliché, but it’s not. Thus, I just don’t want to deliver, I want to actually be part of the building, the innovation, the tweaking. Actually be in the core and source of change itself. And I anxiously look forward to do so as a software developer.

Alright, back to work.
